# USM Handbook

Bienvenido al mejor apunte numero 13!


## Requeriments
- Typst

## How to compile

```sh
typst compile main.typ
```

## Rules

- Each folder must be written separated by "-" and in lowercase
- Every file name must be written in lowercase
- Only file extensions allowed are ".cpp" and ".typ
- If the filename length is more than 18 characters, use a short name (example: knuth-morris-pratt to kmp)
- Forbidden the use of macros like "rep", "repx" or any variant
- Every template code must have a description in their first lines
- The tabulation for each file must be of **2** spaces
- Each file must be atomic, that means you can not put two differents codes on the same file (Sometimes is needed btw)

## Objectives
- Shorten codes
- Writing descriptions and testing codes

## To be added
- More dynamic programming techniques
- Monotonic tree
- Cartesian tree
- LCA using RMQ
- Disjoint Sparse Table
- Voronoi/Delaunay
- Line, circle and more things for geometry
